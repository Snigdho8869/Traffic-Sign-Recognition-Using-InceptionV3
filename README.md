# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Using-InceptionV3

This repository contains code for detecting traffic signs using Inception model, trained on a large dataset of traffic sign images. The model achieves high accuracy in identifying various types of traffic signs, including speed limit signs, stop signs, yield signs, and many more.

# Dataset:

A custom Traffic Sign Recognition dataset was used to train and evaluate the Inception model. The dataset contains 5829 images of 58 different types of traffic signs.

# Requirements:

* Python 
* TensorFlow 
* NumPy
* Keras

# Results:

The Inception model achieves an accuracy of over 97%, making it a highly effective tool for traffic sign detection.

# Application Interface:
